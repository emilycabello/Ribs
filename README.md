# Ribs Project Two
by Emily Cabello

# project overview

This website represents what community means to me though the lyrics of Lorde's song, "Ribs." This song is about finding comfort in difficult situations through friendship and the memories created with loved ones. 


# technical overview

This website was made in Visual Studio Code using 7 html pages linked to each other in a loop so users can restart at the end. All pages are styled with one CSS page with CSS animations, hover effects, and the Google Font "Oooh Baby." All type has a fade in effect and a soft outer glow, meant to fit the song's nostalgic theme. Text that links to a new page stands out by being a soft pink, and all pages' links have some animated element.
