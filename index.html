            <p1> This dream isn't feeling sweet, we're reeling through the midnight streets
                And I've never felt more alone, feels so scary getting old
                This dream isn't feeling sweet, we're reeling through the midnight streets
                And I've never felt more alone, feels so scary getting old
                I want 'em back, I want 'em back
                The minds we had, the minds we had
                How all the thoughts, how all the thoughts
                Moved 'round our heads, moved 'round our heads
                I want 'em back, I want 'em back
                The minds we had, the minds we had
                It's not enough to feel the lack
                I want 'em back, I want 'em back, I want 'em
                You're the only friend I need (you're the only friend I need)
                Sharing beds like little kids (sharing beds like little kids)
                And laughing 'til our ribs get tough (laughing 'til our ribs get tough)
                But that will never be enough (but that will never be enough) </p1>
